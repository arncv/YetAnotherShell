## YetAnotherShell

Welcome to YetAnotherShell. This is a quirky and (let's be honest) somewhat useless shell crafted with love in Rust. If you've ever wished for a shell that could roast you while you work, you've stumbled upon the right place!

## 🌟 Features

**Basic Shell Commands**: Seamlessly navigate through directories with cd, execute any command, and even chain commands using |.

**Get Roasted**: Feeling a tad overconfident? Punch in roast_me and let the shell serve you a cheeky roast.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Installation Steps**

Clone the Repository:

```git clone https://github.com/arncv/YetAnotherShell.git```

Enter the Project Directory:

## 🛠 Usage

Once you've fired up the shell, you'll be greeted with a > prompt. Here's a quick guide:

**Navigate Directories:**
```> cd path/to/directory```

**Execute Commands:**

```> your_command_here```
**Chain Commands:**
```> command1 | command2 | command3```
